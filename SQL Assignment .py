# <h2> we will use the cast substring when selecting year from now 

# <h2> We will use trim(whatever column name) to remove trailing spaces

# ## Useful tips:
# 
# 1. the year column in 'Movie' table, will have few chracters other than numbers which you need to be preprocessed, you need to get a substring of last 4 characters, its better if you convert it as int type, ex: CAST(SUBSTR(TRIM(m.year),-4) AS INTEGER)
# 
# 2. For almost all the TEXT columns we have show, please try to remove trailing spaces, you need to use TRIM() function
# 
# 3. When you are doing count(coulmn) it won't consider the "NULL" values, you might need to explore other alternatives like Count(*)

# ## Q1 --- List all the directors who directed a 'Comedy' movie in a leap year. (You need to check that the genre is 'Comedyâ€™ and year is a leap year) Your query should return director name, the movie name, and the year.

# <h4>To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:</h4>
# 
# <ul>
#     <li><b>STEP-1:</b> If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.</li>
#     <li><b>STEP-2:</b> If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.</li>
#     <li><b>STEP-3:</b> If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.</li>
#     <li><b>STEP-4:</b> The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).</li>
#     <li><b>STEP-5:</b> The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).</li>
# </ul>
# 
# Year 1900 is divisible by 4 and 100 but it is not divisible by 400, so it is not a leap year.
